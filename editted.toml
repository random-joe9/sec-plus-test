question_number = "Test B3"
question = "The lessons-learned analysis from a recent incident reveal that an administrative office worker received a call from someone claiming to be from technical support. The caller convinced the office worker to visit a website, download, and install a program masquerading as an antivirus package. The program was actually a backdoor that an attacker could later use to remote control the worker's PC.\nWhich of the following would be BEST to help prevent this type of attack in the future?"
answers = ["Application whitelisting"]
alternatives = ["Data loss prevention", "Segmentation", "Quarantine"]
explanation = "The correct answer is 'Application whitelisting.' Application whitelisting is a security practice that allows only approved and trusted applications to run on a system while blocking unauthorized applications. In this scenario, using application whitelisting would prevent the installation and execution of unauthorized and potentially malicious programs, like the backdoor masquerading as an antivirus package. Data loss prevention (DLP), segmentation, and quarantine may address other aspects of security, but they do not directly prevent the installation of unauthorized software."
