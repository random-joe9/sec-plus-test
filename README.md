A company is setting up a web server on the Internet that will utilize both encrypted and unencrypted web browsing protocols. A security engineer runs a port scan against the server from the Internet and sees the following output:

Port Protocol State    Service
22    tcp     open     ssh 
25    tcp     filtered smtp 
53    tcp     filtered domain 
80    tcp     open     http 
443   tcp     open     https

Which of the following steps would be best for the security engineer to take NEXT?
"""
answers = ["Allow DNS access from the Internet"]
alternatives = ["Block SMTP access from the Internet", "Block HTTPS access from the Internet", "Block SSH access from the Internet"]
explanation = "The port scan results indicate that DNS (port 53) is filtered, meaning it may be blocked. To ensure proper DNS functionality for web browsing, the security engineer should allow DNS access from the Internet. Blocking other services like SMTP, HTTPS, or SSH may disrupt essential functionalities."
hint = "Consider which service needs to be allowed for proper web browsing functionality."
